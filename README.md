# Module 5 Challenge: Pymaceuticals Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a pharmaceutical study investigating the effectiveness of four drug regimens in reducing tumor sizes in mice. The project uses Python, Matplotlib, and Pandas to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Overview
Key objectives:
- Compare tumor volume distributions across drug regimens.
- Explore correlations between mouse weight and tumor volume.
- Identify outliers and calculate summary statistics.

## Files
- `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and visualizations.
- `Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv`: Datasets used for the analysis.

## Key Findings
1. Capomulin and Ramicane regimens had the lowest average tumor volumes, indicating higher effectiveness.
2. A strong positive correlation (~0.84) was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen.
3. Infubinol displayed notable outliers in tumor volume distribution, suggesting variability in its effectiveness.
